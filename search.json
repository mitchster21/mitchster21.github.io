    "text": "Goal: Compare a simple, interpretable model (logistic regression) with a more flexible, complex model (random forest) for predicting whether the home team wins. We’ll walk through data simulation, training, evaluation, and interpretation.\n\n\n\nTo keep things simple, we simulate a small sports dataset in a separate Python script compare_models.py. Each row represents a matchup with:\n\nhome_score: points scored by the home team\n\naway_score: points scored by the away team\n\nhome_advantage: a feature that encodes “home-court” advantage\n\ntarget: whether the home team won (1) or lost (0)\n\nThis practice data keeps the focus on model comparison instead of data wrangling.\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate how logistic regression and random forest handle different data patterns, we simulate a small sports dataset. Outcomes depend on nonlinear effects and interactions, which are easier for random forests to capture than logistic regression.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Simulate a simple matchup dataset\nn_games = 2000\nhome = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, n_games)\nstrength_diff = np.random.normal(0, 1, n_games)\nrest_diff = np.random.normal(0, 1, n_games)\n\n# Outcome depends on nonlinear interactions\nlin = 1.2 * home * strength_diff - 0.7 * rest_diff**2 + 0.5 * strength_diff**3\np_home_win = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-lin))\ny = np.random.binomial(1, p_home_win)\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"home\": home,\n    \"strength_diff\": strength_diff,\n    \"rest_diff\": rest_diff,\n    \"home_win\": y\n})\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhome\nstrength_diff\nrest_diff\nhome_win\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n-0.751062\n-1.892568\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n-0.639119\n0.333151\n1\n\n\n2\n1\n0.142086\n-0.198534\n0\n\n\n3\n1\n-0.102699\n-1.113040\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n0.967439\n-0.900677\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic regression is the baseline.
